# Money Cashboard Project

Build a simple money tracking app to help user to keep track of his spendings and allow him to see them by category and date.

### MVP

Create new transactions
Display a list of all transactions
Display total amount spent
Display total amount spent by tag

## What I did

My first web application which allows the users to add, edit and delete their transactions as well as see them all listed on the main page. Transactions can be filtered by date and category and see the total amount spent per each. Users are warned when their budget is exceed and are also able to add a new shopping location or store into their list.
The page is easy to navigate and simple designed using mainly three colours.
